## Opening the Extension

Simply install the extension. It's enabled by default whenever you create a new post.

## Installing locally on Chrome
You can run the extension locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store.

1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP".
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the [main folder](https://github.com/maxontech/twitter-font-editor/tree/master/main) (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use the extension locally.
